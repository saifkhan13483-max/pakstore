Implementation Notes:
Sequential Approach: Use these prompts in order, as later parts depend on components and functionality created in earlier parts.

Testing Strategy: After every 3-4 parts, test the implemented functionality to ensure everything works correctly before proceeding.

Pakistan Focus: Each part maintains focus on Pakistani market requirements including currency formatting, phone number validation, city selection, and cultural preferences.

Vercel Compatibility: All parts are designed to ensure smooth Vercel deployment without additional configuration requirements.
